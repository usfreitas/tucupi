# tucupi
An interactive tool to manage and delete duplicated files

This program is very alpha at the moment, although it can be useful. It looks 
for repeated (or duplicated) files in the file system and presents a (hopefully) 
easy to use interface to help the user decide which files to keep and which to delete.

It is named after a Brazilian sauce made from wild manioc roots.
The [sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupi) can be poisonous if not prepared
correctly. This program can also be dangerous as it deals with deleting files.
